# Plague
Modern plague simulator.
Sort of.

So basically for now we have:

Headers:
- Plague.h : infection model class. The class should contain the two core methods Flow and Simulate that should compute the deterministic and the stochatic predictions about the disease spread
- qsliderfromzero.h
- scaledvaluelabel.h
- window.h : its slote simulate() activates the model functions detPredict and stochPredict


Raw implementation:
- utils.cpp : utility methods that are not substantial part of a Plague class

- main.cpp: for now it prints the Flow() on SO but will change soon and be smt generated by QT.
